      <p>Hi, and welcome to Epicodus. Computer programming is done using different languages. All major programming languages perform in very similar ways, however some are better than others for completed particular tasks. At Epicodus you will be asked to choose a language to study. We have developed a short survery to help you determine what language might best fit your personality.
