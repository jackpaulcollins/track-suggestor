      <p>Hi, and welcome to Epicodus. Computer programming is done using different languages. A computer language is similar to human languages in that they all differ in some way - syntaxt, punction, etc., yet they all aim to achieve the same goal:  to efficiently allow the computer to communicate. Because there are differences between the languages, some are better than others for completed particular tasks. At Epicodus you will be asked to choose a language to study. We have developed a short survery to help you determine what language might best fit your personality.
